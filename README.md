# stock-prediction-nse-basic-analysis-of-stock-prediction-using-ml-dl
This is basic analysis of how ml/dl model came up to predict stocks.We know the price of particular stock depends on various factors and not only on previous days prices itself and even though it is said that past price movements never reflect in future , just tried to build a model which is better than random.


I have applied both linear models and RNN model to predict stock movement .

Linear models :Input- previous day's data to predict tommorow's closing prices.


DL models: Input-n previous days data to predict m days future closing prices.
